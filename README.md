This project is an assignment from Lexicon, to develop a simulation system for a Zoo. 

I was tasked with developing an object-oriented system to simulate a zoo. The system should manage different types of animals and their interactions within the park. The goal is to create a dynamic environment where animals can eat, sleep and interact with each other and the park's visitors.
